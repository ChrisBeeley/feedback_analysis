# Patient feedback analytic tool

This application will ultimately allow staff in different Trusts in the NHS to upload their patient experience data and then analyse and explore the data, with a particular emphasis on using machine learning tools to enhance discoverability and encourage users to read verbatim feedback rather than just being presented with a single score or trend.

At the moment it's all just processing, topic modelling, sentiment analysis etc. but I plan to build a Shiny dashboard to go with this work.

It's worth noting that I have ditched Jupyter Notebooks in the browser in favour of [Hydrogen with Atom](https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen). So that's why the Python scripts are marked up like that.
